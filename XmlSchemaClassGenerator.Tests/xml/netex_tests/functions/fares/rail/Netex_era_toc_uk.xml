Domestic Rail Example

This example provides an example of encoding  a   rail fare   in NeTEx XML based on Greater Anglia Operator

UK Train Operating Companies  offer a set of common productst, plus their own additional special offers

It demonstrates 

     - Multi operator and  single operator products  combined into sales packages
       Trips - Point to point, Single & Return 
     - Multiple fare demand types: flexible & semiflexible a 
       Zonal add_ons (Plusbus)
       Season Passes
       Railcards

      
 Based on data on 
https://www.greateranglia.co.uk/tickets-fares

and 

http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types.aspx


Please note the example is not   exhaustive, nor is completely correct  (it also has  a small amount of  made up date to illustrate additional points, for example, for quotas) 
 It is intended to demonstrate how   different  types of complex products and  complex rules can be encoded in NeTEx, not to fully represent actual products.

												<Name>No Ticket</Name>
												<Description>Travelling without a valid Ticket
9.1. Travelling without a valid Ticket (which includes, where relevant, any supporting documentation such as a Railcard), or being unable to present them when asked is a serious matter. Condition 6 sets out the only circumstances where you may board a train without a valid Ticket. If you believe that one of these circumstances applies to you, or that there is another reason that led to you travelling without a valid Ticket or being able to present one, then you should explain this to the member of Train Company staff who has asked to
inspect your Ticket.
9.2. If you are unable to present a valid Ticket when asked and the conditions set out in Condition 6 do not apply, we are permitted in law to take one of the following measures:
9.2.1. To charge you a Penalty Fare on certain trains and stations (see Condition 10 below); or
9.2.2. To charge you the full undiscounted anytime single fare to a station directly served by the train that you are on. You will not be entitled to any discounts or special terms, or for a Ticket to a station other than one served by the train that you are on; or
9.2.3. To report you for prosecution.
 
 
10. Penalty Fares
10.1. Some Train Companies operate a Penalty Fares scheme. All such schemes operate on the same basis, and are approved by the Department for Transport. More information on Penalty Fare schemes and a list of the Train Companies operating such schemes can be found at www.nationalrail.co.uk/tickets.
10.2. Train Companies are required to ensure that warning notices are clearly displayed on trains and stations where such schemes operate. Within the areas where such schemes operate, you may be charged a Penalty Fare if:
10.2.1. You travel on a train service without a Ticket or Permit to Travel; or
10.2.2. You travel in first class accommodation with a standard class Ticket; or
10.2.3. You travel on a train service at a time when your Ticket is not valid; or
10.2.4. You travel with a Train Company for which your Ticket is not valid; or
10.2.5. You do not have the necessary supporting document(s), where required (for example a valid Railcard or photocard).</Description>

												<Description>Travelling without a valid Ticket - wrong ticket 
9.4. Where you are using a Ticket valid on a specific train service or train services (such as an 'advance' Ticket) and you miss a service because a previous connecting train service was delayed, you will be able to travel on the next train service provided by the Train Company with whom you were booked without penalty.
9.5. Where you are using a time-restricted Ticket (such as an 'off-peak' or 'super-off-peak' Ticket) that is correctly dated but:
9.5.1. invalid for the service on which you are travelling; or
9.5.2. you are using a route for which your Ticket is not valid; or
9.5.3. you break your journey when you are not permitted to do so, you will be charged the difference between the fare that you have paid and the lowest price Ticket that is valid for the train you are using.


10.1 Some Train Companies operate a Penalty Fares scheme. All such schemes  operate on the same basis, and are approved by the Department for  Transport. More information on Penalty Fare schemes and a list of the Train  Companies operating such schemes can be found at www.nationalrail.co.uk/  tickets.
10.2 Train Companies are required to ensure that warning notices are clearly  displayed on trains and stations where such schemes operate. Within the  areas where such schemes operate, you may be charged a Penalty Fare if:
 (a) You travel on a train service without a Ticket or Permit to Travel;
 (b) You travel in first class accommodation with a standard class Ticket;
 (c) You travel on a train service at a time when your Ticket is not valid;
 (d) You travel with a Train Company for which your Ticket is not valid;

												<Description>16. Break of journey
16.1. Most Tickets allow you to break your journey. This means that you do not have to make the whole of your journey at the same time or, where allowed, on the same day.
16.2. Where break of journey is allowed, there is no limit to the number of times that you can do so within a Ticket's period of validity, until the journey is completed.
16.3. Generally, you may start, or break and resume, a journey (in either direction in the case of a return Ticket) at any intermediate station, as long as the Ticket you hold is
valid for the trains you want to use. However, this may not be the case with some through services that take an indirect route. You may also end your journey (in either
direction in the case of a return Ticket) before the destination shown on the Ticket. 
INFORMATION: Please note that advance Tickets do not permit a break of journey. The special conditions for advance Tickets can be found at www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types/46546.aspx.
Other national Ticket types normally allow break of journey with the exception of the outward portion of some longer distance off-peak returns. Where this is the case it is made clear in the restrictions applying to those tickets.
INFORMATION: For example, where a train service makes a circular journey, you may travel either way to the destination on your ticket. However, you would not normally be allowed to get off at an intermediate station where the fare would have been higher.</Description>

Advance tickets are usually the cheapest way to travel by train, and generally go on sale 12 weeks before your date of travel. You have to travel on the train you're booked on, but you get a much cheaper price by foregoing flexible travel times. Full details on Advance tickets can be found here. But how late can you buy an Advance ticket before you travel? The deadline used to be 18:00 on the day before travel - but many train companies now allow you to buy an Advance ticket much later than this, even on the day of travel itself. 
Every train company that sells Advance tickets has its own deadlines. This can vary on whether you buy your ticket direct with the train company, from an online retailer, or from a station. Please find the details for your train company below:</Description>

							<Description>Crossing London with tickets marked  "CROSS"
If your journey involves travelling via, or across London to connect with another National Rail service, your ticket should include the cost of transfer on London Underground, DLR or Thameslink services between the relevant main London stations.

For example - a Hastings to York ticket is valid for travel on Underground services between Victoria, Charing Cross, Cannon Street or London Bridge and Kings Cross St Pancras stations, or on Thameslink services from London Bridge or Blackfriars to St. Pancras International.
To check if the cost of travel across London is included in your ticket, look for the 'CROSS' symbol which will be shown in the tickets 'Route' information, e.g. ['CROSS' ANY PERMITTED].

Tickets displaying this indicator are valid for travel between any two stations shown in the 'Station List'(below) appropriate to the route of the through journey being made.

You can 'break your transfer journey' and leave the Underground at any intermediate station, e.g. if you are travelling between Victoria and Euston you can exit at Oxford Circus. However, if you subsequently wish to continue your journey by Underground you will have to purchase another ticket.

List of London Underground and DLR Stations between which single/return tickets valid for travel 'via London' may be used - subject to route of the through journey being made. </Description>

=======================================
 Buy anytime, travel off peak

What are Off-Peak tickets?
Off-Peak fares are cheaper tickets for travelling on trains that are less busy.

Offering good value for money, these tickets may require you to travel at specific times of day, days of the week or on a specific route. Where there is more than one Off-Peak fare for a journey, the cheaper fare with more restrictions will be called Super Off-Peak.

You can buy Off-Peak tickets any time before you travel. The travel restrictions for your Off-Peak ticket will depend on the journey you are making and will be advised when you buy your ticket.

When can I use an Off-Peak ticket?
The trains that you can catch and the times that you can travel with an Off-Peak ticket vary considerably depending on the journey being made, the day/date of travel and the train company that you are travelling with. Please use the Journey Planner to choose your desired time of travel and click 'check ticket availability and prices' to display the complete range of fares available for your journey.

Can I get a discount?
Child discounts apply for all Off-Peak fares.
Railcard holders get 1/3 off all Off-Peak fares. Senior, HM Forces and Disabled Persons Railcard holders also get 1/3 off all First Class Off-Peak fares.

Please note that minimum fares / time restrictions may apply to tickets bought with a 16-25 Railcard.
What are the Terms and Conditions?

These are obtainable, free of charge, from any staffed railway ticket office. The adult rate photocard (for those aged 16 or over)  is the pink sample shown. All you need to get one of these is a passport size photograph. The child rate photocard (for those aged 5-15 when the term starts) is the yellow sample shown. To get one of these you must present a passport size photograph and a copy of the childs birth certificate to a staffed railway ticket office.

***THE PHOTOCARD NUMBER***

This is combination of numbers and letters in black on the photocard. On the newer photocards this will be shown underneath the barcode (as in the samples shown).


***CHILD PHOTOCARDS-MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN DATE***
Please make sure that your child rate photocard is in date (not past the "Valid Until" date shown on the card). Children who are aged 15 at the start fo the term but then turn 16 during the term can still obtain a child rate ticket for the whole term using their existing photocard (provided it was in date at the start of the term)turn 16 during the term can still obtain a child rate ticket for the whole term using their existing photocard (provided it was in date at the start of the term)

							<Description>Season pass - paily trip between origin and destination
 If you make the same journey more than three times a week you may find that, on the majority of routes, Season Tickets offer better value for money compared to buying daily tickets. Season Tickets allow unlimited travel in both directions between the stations specified.
 
======
How long can a Season Ticket be valid for?
You can buy a season ticket for seven days or any period between one month and a year:

Seven Days: You can use the ticket at any time during any seven day period for travel between the points shown on the ticket - the more you travel, the more you save!

A month: Monthly Season Tickets offer great savings compared to buying four individual Seven Day season tickets.

Over one month: 
Season Tickets can also be purchased for any duration between one month and one year.

======
What sort of journey can I buy a Season Ticket for?
Season Tickets are available for most short and medium distance journeys on the National Rail network. Season Tickets are not generally available for long distance journeys, but maybe available where a train company chooses to offer them.

For very long journeys, an All Line Rail Rover Ticket can work out a lot cheaper than buying individual tickets and gives the added bonus of unlimited travel anywhere on the National Rail Network. They are available for periods of 7 or 14 days - more information can be found on our Special Offers page.

Buying a Season Ticket
Season Tickets are available for most short and medium distance journeys on the National Rail network. Season Tickets are not generally available for long distance journeys, but maybe available where a train company chooses to offer them.
For very long journeys, an All Line Rail Rover Ticket can work out a lot cheaper than buying individual tickets and gives the added bonus of Unlimited Travel ANYWHERE on the National Rail Network. All Line Rail Rovers are available for periods of 7 days or 14 days. Other regional Rail Rovers may be available but usually have some time restrictions during peak hours - more information can be found on our Special Offers page.

								<!-- Where can I buy a ticket?
http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/ticket_types/season_tickets.aspx#how
You can buy a season ticket at any staffed ticket office. If you are buying a season ticket for the first time, you may need to have a Photocard created.
For Monthly or longer season tickets, you may need to complete an application form or have a 'season ticket record' created
If necessary, you will need to provide a passport-type photograph for the accompanying Photocard
If you already have a Photocard, you may be able to buy seven day season tickets at self-service ticket vending machines
Photocards do not have an expiry date and can be reused when a season ticket expires
To avoid the queues, it's best to avoid buying your ticket on weekday mornings See table above for when to buy or renew Season Tickets
You may also be able to buy your tickets over the telephone or internet from the appropriate Train Company. -->

							<Description>Annual Gold Cards
If you buy an Annual Season ticket or Annual Travelcard in the South of England, you may qualify for an Annual Gold Card which offer discounts on leisure rail travel.

What is an Annual Gold Card?
Annual Gold Cards are Annual Season tickets with a difference!

When you buy an adult Annual Season ticket or Annual Travelcard online or at a station within the Annual Gold Card area and the origin and/or destination are also in the Annual Gold Card area, you are automatically issued with an Annual Gold Card. If your Season ticket is issued on smart_card or an Oyster card, you will be eligible to automatically receive a Gold Record Card to your registered address.

As well as being a Season ticket for a full year, you also get a range of discounts on other leisure rail journeys in the Annual Gold Card area for both yourself and others.

How much do Annual Gold Card Season tickets cost?
Annual Season tickets are a great way of saving money across the year as, on average, the cost of an Annual Season ticket is calculated to the same as approximately 40 x 7-Day Season tickets so the savings could work out to be huge (and effectively up to 12 weeks of free travel)!
 
What discounts do I get?
   See Entitlements  below 
Disabled Persons Railcards are not available to buy at stations. Please contact the Disabled Persons Railcard office for details on how to apply online:

Email: disability@raildeliverygroup.com
Tel: 0345 605 0525

Alternatively applications for a Disabled Persons Railcard can be made by post by completing and returning the application form, evidence of eligibility and a copy of the front and back of the Annual Gold Card to the Disabled Persons Railcard office, PO Box 6613, Arbroath, DD11 9AN.

							<Description>Advance tickets - Latest purchase time. Advance tickets are usually the cheapest way to travel by train, and generally go on sale 12 weeks before your date of travel. You have to travel on the train you're booked on, but you get a much cheaper price by foregoing flexible travel times. Full details on Advance tickets can be found here. 
But how late can you buy an Advance ticket before you travel? The deadline used to be 18:00 on the day before travel - but many train companies now allow you to buy an Advance ticket much later than this, even on the day of travel itself. 
Greater Anglia	10 minutes before departure: Where Advance tickets are available (except Southend services), you can now buy Advance Purchase on the day tickets up to 10 minutes before the departure of your chosen train - on the Greater Anglia website and the GA App. More information is available via the link.</Description>

							<Description>Ten single tickets for the price of nine. 
Carnet tickets are available to purchase between most Greater Anglia stations and London Liverpool Street, in either direction. Please note that Carnet tickets can only be used in the direction shown on the ticket, so you will need to buy a separate book of tickets to travel in the other direction.

They are priced at 10% below half of the Anytime Return fare and are valid for three months. Carnet tickets are sold in quantities of ten.		
 
They are a reduced price bulk purchase of 10 return tickets. Essentially you get 10 return tickets to use within three months. You must date each ticket prior to boarding your train.
The price for each set of 10 tickets is based on 9 return ticket prices (so you get 10 tickets for the price of 9). 

***PLEASE NOTE*** Carnet tickets are non-refundable.

Anytime Day Travelcard
The Anytime Day Travelcard is available from all Greater Anglia stations. From outside Greater London it offers one return train journey to London, at any time of the day during the week and includes unlimited use of the transport network in Greater London. This covers the London Underground, London Overground, almost all other National Rail services, all scheduled London Buses, the DLR (Docklands Light Railway) and the London Tramlink system in south London.

A small number of exceptions apply - please see the Terms and Conditions

https://www.greateranglia.co.uk/tickets-fares/daily-tickets/anytime-tickets/travelcard-terms
When and where the ticket can be used
Anytime Day Travelcards are valid for unlimited travel:

On National Rail (but not Heathrow Express services, nor on Heathrow Connect between Hayes &amp;Harlington and Heathrow, also not on South Eastern High Speed services from London St Pancras to Stratford International and beyond), London Underground, and Docklands Light Railway services within the London Area Fare Zones for which the ticket is issued.
Across the London bus network, irrespective of the zones shown on the ticket and including sections outside Greater London, but not on certain special bus services and excursions.
On London Tramlink services where the Travelcard includes Fare Zones 3 or 4 or 5 or 6.
Save 1/3 on scheduled Riverboat services by showing your valid Travelcard at the time of travel.
Child prices apply to all children aged 5-15 years inclusive.
Up to two accompanied children per adult under the age of 5 years can travel free on National Rail services.
In-boundary (from stations within London Fare Zones 1-6)
Anytime Day Travelcards are valid for unlimited travel from 00:01 Mondays to Fridays, (except public holidays) on the day for which the ticket is dated and until 04:29 the next morning.
Out-boundary (i.e. from stations outside the London Fare Zones area)
Within the London Fare Zones area Anytime Day Travelcards are valid on the day for which the ticket is dated and until 04:29 the next morning.
The validity of the Anytime Day Travelcard ends on completion of the return journey to the originating station.
The outward and return journey between the originating station and the Fare Zones area boundary station must be made on Greater Anglia services where tickets are specifically routed as such (this currently only applies to "Greater Anglia only" tickets from Cambridge).

When and where the ticket can be used
Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets may require you to travel at specific times of day, days of the week or on a specific route, but can be used at any time weekends and Bank Holidays.

Our journey planner can tell you when your ticket can be used - simply enter your outward and return journey times to see the trains you can travel on. You can also buy your train ticket using the journey planner.

Plan your journey

Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak Singles and the outward part of Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak Return tickets are valid for travel on the date shown on your ticket and until 04:29 the following morning. If the journey cannot be completed in this time, the ticket may be used to continue the journey on the following day.

Unless otherwise indicated in the relevant restriction code, time restrictions apply as from the initial origin station on both days. The appropriate restrictions for the actual day on which travel is being undertaken apply (for example, it may be that if day one is on Sunday, no restrictions apply, but on day two, the Monday-Friday restrictions apply). All travel must be completed by 04:29 in the morning after this second day. Please note that break of journey is not permitted on some journeys, as detailed in the ticket restrictions.

For Greater Anglia journeys, Off-Peak tickets are valid for any train scheduled to arrive at London Liverpool Street or London Kings Cross at or after 10:00, Stratford (London) after 09:50, Tottenham Hale/Seven Sisters after 09:40. Not valid on any train departing London Liverpool Street or Kings Cross before 09:30 or between 16:29 or 18:34 inclusive (19:00 from Kings Cross) although travel is permitted on certain trains at the beginning and end of the evening restricted period to stations on the Felixstowe, Sudbury and Braintree branch lines.

Return portions of Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak Return tickets are valid for travel within one calendar month of the first date of validity. They are valid for travel until 04:29 on the day following the last day of validity. All travel must be completed by this time. They are not valid on any train departing London Liverpool Street or London Kings Cross before 09:30 and not between 16:29 or 18:34 inclusive (19:00 from London Kings Cross) although travel is permitted on certain trains at the beginning and end of the evening restricted period to stations on the Felixstowe, Sudbury and Braintree branch lines.

If the route shown on the ticket has a "+", the ticket includes the cost of travelling between certain London Stations (e.g. between Liverpool St and Paddington) by either London Underground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) or First Capital Connect (Thameslink Route) services appropriate to the route of the journey being made.

More information about travelling across London to connect with another National Rail service

Note: Tickets will only be accepted by London Underground and DLR on the date shown on the ticket (or last day of validity for return portions of Off-Peak Returns) and until close of service in the early hours of the following day. Other than to change trains, a break of journey at intermediate London Underground or DLR stations is not permitted.

Time restrictions do not apply on weekends and public holidays.

Conditions of use
You must travel in the class of accommodation shown on your ticket.

Railcard holders travelling on a discounted ticket must carry their Railcard when they travel. If a Railcard holder fails to produce their valid Railcard with their ticket, they will be required to pay a full priced ticket for their journey as if no Railcard and/or no ticket were held.

The outward part of an Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak Return ticket is only valid for travel when accompanied by an unused return part of the same ticket.

First Class Off-Peak tickets may provide access to First Class Lounges at stations. For more information check the First Class page on National Rail

Break of journey
Break of journey is allowed on Off-Peak tickets unless restricted for the journey you are making. If you intend to break your journey, please call 03457 48 49 50 to check if it is available on your specific journey.

Changing the time or date of travel
If you wish to change your time of travel to peak time or upgrade the class of the ticket, you can pay the difference between the cost of the ticket held and the cost of the ticket that is most appropriate for the journey you need to make. As Off-Peak tickets do not restrict you to travelling on a particular train, if you wish to travel on a different off-peak service from the one you originally intended to use, no excess fare will be payable, provided that the ticket is not out of date.

If you wish to change the date of travel, or the origin or destination of your ticket, it may be necessary to buy a new ticket and apply for a refund on your existing ticket (see below).

Refunds
The Off-Peak ticket is refundable.

If you decide not to use your Off-Peak ticket to make all or part of your intended journey then you can get a refund by returning your unused ticket to the ticket office or place of purchase (for tickets bought via websites, telesales or travel agents) within 28 days of the ticket expiry date. You may be required to pay an administration fee.

The refund amount will normally take into account any use you have made of the ticket and in some circumstances no refund will be paid.

All tickets and travel are subject to National Rail Conditions of Carriage

Advance Tickets
Where are Advance tickets available?
Advance tickets are available on the following Greater Anglia routes:

London to Ipswich, Stowmarket, Diss and Norwich
London to branch lines in Norfolk and Suffolk, including the lines to Cromer and Sheringham, Great Yarmouth, Lowestoft, Bury St Edmunds and Felixstowe
London to Colchester, and stations to Clacton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze
London to Audley End and stations to Cambridge
London to Ely and stations to King's Lynn (Greater Anglia through trains - weekday peak times only)
London to Prittlewell and Southend Victoria (less busy times of day only)
Many other intermediate journeys.
Advance tickets are also available on many through journeys to other parts of the country.
 
Why travel with Advance tickets?

Tickets are priced as single leg fares so you can choose the lowest available price for each leg of your journey (out and back)
You book to travel at your specified time
It's cost effective with fares starting at  GBP 10 single between London and Norwich,  GBP 7 single between London and Cambridge and  GBP 5 single between London and Southend (depending on availability and time of travel)
Railcard and Child discounts apply to all Advance fares (see Railcard Discounts below for details on which Railcards are valid)
You can check out our First Class Advance fares - they are often cheaper than you might expect 

On the London to Norwich main line, a free seat reservation is included, except for the last three services each evening from London, which have free seating.
Check details and book early as Advance tickets are subject to limited availability and may not be available on every train.

Advance tickets are normally released 12 weeks before the departure date of the train.
 
You must travel on your booked service or the ticket will not be valid.

However, if you have arrived on a flight at either Norwich Airport or Southend Airport, and your flight was delayed, your Advance ticket will be valid on the next available Greater Anglia service. See Advance ticket terms and conditions for full details.

Changes to Advance tickets are possible before the departure of the first reserved train. An administration fee is payable. 
With PlusBus you can add unlimited bus travel within your destination town. You can also buy a PlusBus ticket for the town where you are starting your journey. PlusBus is available in hundreds of towns and cities
 in the UK. For details see the PlusBus website

Railcard discounts
16-25, Senior, Two Together, HM Forces and Disabled Persons Railcard holders can save 1/3 on First and Standard Class Advance tickets. Family and Friends Railcard holders can save 1/3 on all Standard Class Advance tickets.

Advance Purchase on the Day
On all Greater Anglia services where Advance tickets are available (except Southend services), you can now buy Advance tickets up to ten minutes before the departure of your chosen train. Advance Purchase on the day tickets cost less than the equivalent flexible Single ticket. Seat reservations are not provided, but, like pre-booked Advance tickets, travel must be on the specified train only. Advance Purchase on the Day tickets are available to buy on the Greater Anglia website and the GA App. You can choose to have your ticket delivered to your smartphone as a mobile ticket, or sent to you as a pdf e-ticket that you can either show on your phone or print out. Alternatively,you can choose to collect your tickets from a ticket machine at the station (ticket on departure). If you choose this option, if you are a new customer, tickets must be booked at least two hours in advance so that they are available in time for the departure of your train. If you are a returning customer, you can book up to ten minutes before departure even if you choose the 'ticket on departure' option.

Buy tickets online

If you can be flexible with your travel dates/times, our Best Fare Finder helps you find the cheapest Advance fares available.

You can receive your tickets by First Class post (please allow five working days for delivery) or collect your pre-paid tickets from ticket machines at participating stations.

Greater Anglia Advance tickets are also available as Print Your Own and Mobile tickets, so you don't need to wait for them to be posted or have to collect them at stations!
Over the phone
Booking tickets over the phone couldn't be easier. Simply call the Greater Anglia Contact Centre on 0345 600 7245.

Via our app
You can now book tickets on one of our apps. Some routes where Advance tickets are available will also allow your ticket to be sent to your phone.

1. Can I buy PLUSBUS online?
Yes, PLUSBUS day tickets can be purchased at the same time as train tickets online from most rail ticket retailing websites.
 
How will I get my tickets?

When you buy train and PLUSBUS tickets online, you will be asked to choose how you want to obtain your tickets.  The options are:- 

Collect from a self-service ticket machine at the station (for free). If you choose this option and want bus travel to start your journey, then you will have to collect your tickets on a previous occasion.
By post - please allow up to 5 working days for delivery.
Courier - next day delivery is usually available (for a small additional charge);
Collect at the station ticket office.

To start your journey with a bus or tram trip to the station, you must choose to obtain your tickets in advance of the day of travel (by post, courier, or pick-up from a station on a previous occasion).
You must show the actual PLUSBUS ticket to the bus driver (or tram conductor) to travel. We're sorry, an online booking confirmation will not be accepted for travel.

PLUSBUS is a National Rail ticket, whose standard terms and conditions apply (including for ticket refunds).

You must also return the ticket. Some ticket offices (and agents) may charge an administration fee of up to 10 to process refunds.

PLUSBUS tickets bought online may not be refundable from some online agents.

									<Description>14. Are refunds available for PLUSBUS tickets?
PLUSBUS is a National Rail ticket, whose standard terms and conditions apply (including for ticket refunds). If you have bought a PLUSBUS ticket in advance from a station (or online) and do not want to use it, then you may claim a refund from the ticket office (or ticket retailer) that took original payment, but you must do this within 28 days of the travel date shown on the ticket. You must also return the ticket. Some ticket offices (and agents) may charge an administration fee of up to 10 to process refunds.

PLUSBUS tickets bought online may not be refundable from some online agents.

If you have a PLUSBUS season ticket and have used it for a while, but then want a refund of the outstanding period, you can claim a refund from the issuing ticket office. In this case normal National Rail season ticket refund terms and conditions apply.

Train companies prefer customers to buy their tickets before getting on a train (where this is possible), from a ticket office, a self-service ticket machine or in advance by 'phone or online.
 If you are unable to buy your ticket before boarding the train, then you can buy your train ticket and your PLUSBUS ticket from the Conductor or Train Manager on the train (but some Railcard discounts may not be available).

							<Name>London Termini Stations for transfers</Name>
							<Description>'London Terminal' stations
Tickets issued for travel to/from London usually show 'London Terminals' as the destination/origin rather than naming a specific station. This is because the ticket is valid to more than one London Terminal station provided it's on any reasonable line of route. Tickets can only be used on National Rail services.

For example, a ticket from Woking to London Terminals is valid to:

London Waterloo,
London Victoria (via Clapham Junction),
London Bridge,
London Blackfriars,
City Thameslink,
London Charing Cross,
London Waterloo East or
London Cannon Street (via London Bridge).
It would not be valid to, for example, London Euston or Paddington as this would not be on the line of route and would involve crossing London using another mode of transport, such as the London Underground or London Buses.

The exception to this is where there are National Rail journey opportunities that include a choice of London Terminal stations on the Thameslink route between London Bridge, London Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon and London St Pancras. For these journeys the London Terminal stations that you can use with a London Terminals ticket, will be determined by whether your journey will start / finish north or south of London as follows: For information on tickets issued to/from 'London Thameslink' click here

Tickets which restrict travel on services of a specific train company or some special fares may be valid only to a named London Terminal station, e.g. London Kings Cross.

The list of London termini stations, defined as 'London Terminals' for ticketing purposes are:

London Blackfriars - Serves stations on the Bedford/Cambridge/Peterborough to Brighton cross-London 'Thameslink' route and also commuter services to areas of south east London.
